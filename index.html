        <h2>Shigeru Miyamoto was born November 16, 1952. He is a Japanese video game designer, producer and game director at Nintendo, where he serves as one of its representative directors. He is the creator of some of the most acclaimed and best-selling game franchises of all time, including Mario and The Legend of Zelda.

            Born in Sonobe, Japan, he graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts. He originally sought a career as a manga artist, until developing an interest in video games. With the help of his father, he joined Nintendo in 1977 after impressing then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi with his toys. He helped create art for the arcade game Sheriff, and was later tasked with designing a new arcade game for the company. This eventually led to the 1981 game Donkey Kong.

            Miyamoto went on to create both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, which became massive successes for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The games helped Nintendo and the NES to dominate the console game market. His games have been flagships of every Nintendo video game console, from the arcade machines of the late 1970s to the present day. He managed Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development software division, which developed many of the company's first-party titles. As a result of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's death in July 2015, Miyamoto took on the role of acting president alongside Genyo Takeda until being formally appointed as the company's "Creative Fellow" a few months later.</h2>
